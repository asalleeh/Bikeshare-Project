Question: Putting the bike share data aside, think of a topic or field of interest where you would like to be able to apply the techniques of data science. What would you like to be able to learn from your chosen subject?

Answer: I can use data analysis to measure the people usage of technology like example , many institutions and their clients despite the existence of technology, but there is resistance to change, data analytics will help to understand the user behaviour. Amazing practice in this project :)
